# Internshala-Automation
Developed a MERN stack web application that automates job applications on Internshala. The platform allows users to input their details once and automatically applies to relevant internships based on their preferences. Implemented user authentication, profile setup with Recoil for state management, and Puppeteer/Selenium for job application automation.
